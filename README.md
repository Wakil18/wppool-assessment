## Features

### Product Configurator

**Route:** `/app/configurator`

Allows merchants to define configurable product options (fields) and apply them to their catalog.

- **Create Option Sets** — define a named set of fields (text inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons) each with optional price adders
- **Scope targeting** — apply an Option Set to:
  - All products in the store
  - Specific collections
  - Products with specific tags
  - Manually selected products
- **Metafield publishing** — field definitions are written to Shopify product/collection/shop metafields, making them accessible to storefront themes and the cart transform extension
- **Cart transform extension** — a Shopify Functions extension reads configurator selections at checkout and automatically adds a hidden "Custom Options" line item with the correct price adder

### Order Sync

**Route:** `/app/order-sync`

Tracks the sync status of orders to the HoodslyHub CRM.

- Every new order (`orders/create` webhook) is automatically queued for sync
- Displays all sync records with statuses: `Pending`, `Synced`, `Failed`, `Permanently Failed`
- **Filter** by status or search by order ID / customer email
- **Manual retry** on permanently failed orders
- **Rush flag** — toggle a rush marker on any order for priority handling
- Exponential backoff retry logic: up to 3 attempts, then permanently failed

### Order Report

**Route:** `/app/order-report`

Analytics dashboard for order data, pulled live from the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

- **Summary cards** — total orders, total revenue, average order value
- **Filters** — start date, end date, tag (partial match, client-side)
- Supports up to 250 orders per query (adjust `first` in the loader if needed)
- **Export CSV** — downloads a CSV of the currently filtered orders directly in the browser (works inside the Shopify iFrame)

### BirdEye Review Requests

**Route:** `/app/review-log`

Tracks automated review request emails sent to customers after order fulfillment.

- Every fulfilled order (`orders/fulfilled` webhook) automatically triggers a review request via BirdEye
- Uses in-process retry logic (3 attempts, 2 s base delay)
- All attempts are persisted to the `ReviewLog` database table with status (`sent` / `failed`) and attempt count
- **Manual retry** on failed entries directly from the admin UI

---

## Integrations

### HoodslyHub

Syncs new Shopify orders to the HoodslyHub CRM.

**Trigger:** `orders/create` webhook → `webhooks.orders.create.jsx`

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `HOODSLYHUB_ENDPOINT` | `/api/mock/hoodslyhub` (built-in mock) |

The first sync attempt happens synchronously in the webhook handler. Subsequent retries are handled by the [retry processor](#retry-processor-cron). To enable the real integration, set `HOODSLYHUB_ENDPOINT` to your HoodslyHub API URL.

---

### HubSpot CRM

Creates or updates a HubSpot contact and deal for every new order.

**Trigger:** `orders/create` webhook → `webhooks.orders.create.jsx` (fire-and-forget)

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` | Falls back to `/api/mock/hubspot` (built-in mock) |

**Flow:**
1. Search HubSpot for an existing contact by email
2. Create or update the contact (`email`, `firstname`, `lastname`)
3. Create a deal linked to the contact (`dealname` = order name, `amount` = order total)

If `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` is not set, the app logs to the mock endpoint instead of failing silently.

---

### BirdEye

Sends review request emails to customers after order fulfillment.

**Trigger:** `orders/fulfilled` webhook → `webhooks.orders.fulfilled.jsx` (fire-and-forget)

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `BIRDEYE_ENDPOINT` | `/api/mock/birdeye` (built-in mock) |

Payload sent to BirdEye:

```json
{
  "customerEmail": "customer@example.com",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "orderId": "12345678"
}
```

Results are persisted to the `ReviewLog` table whether the request succeeds or fails.

---

## Webhooks

All webhooks are declared in `shopify.app.toml` and registered automatically on `shopify app deploy`.

| Topic | URI | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| `orders/create` | `/webhooks/orders/create` | Creates `OrderSync` record; triggers HoodslyHub + HubSpot sync |
| `orders/fulfilled` | `/webhooks/orders/fulfilled` | Sends BirdEye review request; persists to `ReviewLog` |
| `app/uninstalled` | `/webhooks/app/uninstalled` | Marks shop as uninstalled; deletes sessions |
| `app/scopes_update` | `/webhooks/app/scopes_update` | Updates session scope record when merchant grants/revokes scopes |

> **Note:** Webhooks created manually in the Shopify admin will fail HMAC validation. Always use app-specific webhooks defined in `shopify.app.toml`.

### Triggering webhooks via CLI

```bash
# Trigger an orders/create webhook with test data
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/create

# Trigger an orders/fulfilled webhook
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/fulfilled
```

> The `admin` object will be `undefined` for CLI-triggered webhooks since the shop is simulated.

---

## Retry Processor (Cron)

Failed HoodslyHub syncs are automatically retried via a dedicated endpoint.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/retry-processor`

This endpoint finds all `OrderSync` records with `status = "failed"` where `nextRetryAt <= now()` and re-attempts the sync. It should be called on a schedule (e.g. every 5 minutes via cron, Render cron job, or GitHub Actions).

**Securing the endpoint** (recommended in production):

```bash
# In your .env
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-token
```

Then call the endpoint with a `Bearer` token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" \
  https://your-app-url.com/api/retry-processor
```

If `CRON_SECRET` is not set, the endpoint is open (acceptable for local dev, not for production).

---

## Testing

### Testing integrations with mock endpoints

All three integrations have local mock endpoints. By default they return a success response and log the payload to the console. No external credentials are needed for local development.

| Integration | Success mock | Force failure |
|---|---|---|
| HoodslyHub | `HOODSLYHUB_ENDPOINT` unset → auto mock | `MOCK_HOODSLYHUB_FAIL=true` |
| BirdEye | `BIRDEYE_ENDPOINT` unset → auto mock | `MOCK_BIRDEYE_FAIL=true` |
| HubSpot | `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` unset → auto mock | `MOCK_HUBSPOT_FAIL=true` |

**Example: test HoodslyHub retry logic**

```bash
# In .env — force every HoodslyHub call to fail
MOCK_HOODSLYHUB_FAIL=true
RETRY_DELAY_OVERRIDE_MS=2000   # shorten retry delay to 2 s for fast testing

# Trigger a new order webhook
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/create

# Check the Order Sync dashboard at /app/order-sync
# The record will appear as "Failed" then retry automatically
# Call the retry processor to force a retry immediately:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/retry-processor
```

**Example: test BirdEye failure + manual retry**

```bash
MOCK_BIRDEYE_FAIL=true

# Trigger a fulfillment webhook
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/fulfilled

# Go to /app/review-log — the row will show "failed"
# Click "Retry" to manually re-trigger the request
```

### Testing the Order Report CSV export

1. Navigate to `/app/order-report`
2. Optionally apply date/tag filters
3. Click **Export CSV** — a `.csv` file will download directly in the browser

### Running the retry processor manually

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/retry-processor
```

---

## Building & Deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Database tables don't exist

```
The table `main.Session` does not exist in the current database.
```

Run the setup script to apply migrations:

```bash
npm run setup
```

### Navigating inside the embedded app breaks the session

Shopify embedded apps run inside an iFrame. To avoid session/navigation issues:

1. Use `Link` from `react-router` — never use raw `<a>` tags for in-app navigation
2. Use `redirect` from `authenticate.admin`, not from `react-router`
3. Use `useFetcher` / `useSubmit` from `react-router` for form submissions

### JWT "nbf" claim timestamp check failed

Your machine's clock is out of sync. Enable **"Set time and date automatically"** in your system's Date & Time settings.

### Webhooks failing HMAC validation

Webhooks created manually in the Shopify admin are not signed with your app secret. Only use webhooks declared in `shopify.app.toml`. See: [app-specific webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-subscriptions).

### Shop-specific webhook subscriptions not updating

If you're registering webhooks in the `afterAuth` hook, switch to declaring them in `shopify.app.toml` — Shopify will sync changes automatically on every `shopify app deploy`. If you must use shop-specific webhooks, uninstall and reinstall the app to force `afterAuth` to run again.

### Prisma engine errors on Windows ARM64

```
Unable to require query_engine-windows.dll.node
```

Set this env var to use binary engine mode:

```bash
PRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE=binary
```
