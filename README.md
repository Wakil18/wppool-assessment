## Features

### Product Configurator

**Route:** `/app/configurator`

Allows merchants to define configurable product options (fields) and apply them to their catalog.

- **Create Option Sets** — define a named set of fields (text inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons) each with optional price adders
- **Scope targeting** — apply an Option Set to:
  - All products in the store
  - Specific collections
  - Products with specific tags
  - Manually selected products
- **Metafield publishing** — field definitions are written to Shopify product/collection/shop metafields, making them accessible to storefront themes and the cart transform extension
- **Cart transform extension** — a Shopify Functions extension reads configurator selections at checkout and automatically adds a hidden "Custom Options" line item with the correct price adder

### Order Sync

**Route:** `/app/order-sync`

Tracks the sync status of orders to the HoodslyHub CRM.

- Every new order (`orders/create` webhook) is automatically queued for sync
- Displays all sync records with statuses: `Pending`, `Synced`, `Failed`, `Permanently Failed`
- **Filter** by status or search by order ID / customer email
- **Manual retry** on permanently failed orders
- **Rush flag** — toggle a rush marker on any order for priority handling
- Exponential backoff retry logic: up to 3 attempts, then permanently failed

### Order Report

**Route:** `/app/order-report`

Analytics dashboard for order data, pulled live from the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

- **Summary cards** — total orders, total revenue, average order value
- **Filters** — start date, end date, tag (partial match, client-side)
- Supports up to 250 orders per query (adjust `first` in the loader if needed)
- **Export CSV** — downloads a CSV of the currently filtered orders directly in the browser (works inside the Shopify iFrame)

### BirdEye Review Requests

**Route:** `/app/review-log`

Tracks automated review request emails sent to customers after order fulfillment.

- Every fulfilled order (`orders/fulfilled` webhook) automatically triggers a review request via BirdEye
- Uses in-process retry logic (3 attempts, 2 s base delay)
- All attempts are persisted to the `ReviewLog` database table with status (`sent` / `failed`) and attempt count
- **Manual retry** on failed entries directly from the admin UI

## Integrations

### HoodslyHub

Syncs new Shopify orders to the HoodslyHub CRM.

**Trigger:** `orders/create` webhook → `webhooks.orders.create.jsx`

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `HOODSLYHUB_ENDPOINT` | `/api/mock/hoodslyhub` (built-in mock) |

The first sync attempt happens synchronously in the webhook handler. Subsequent retries are handled by the [retry processor](#retry-processor-cron). To enable the real integration, set `HOODSLYHUB_ENDPOINT` to your HoodslyHub API URL.

---

### HubSpot CRM

Creates or updates a HubSpot contact and deal for every new order.

**Trigger:** `orders/create` webhook → `webhooks.orders.create.jsx` (fire-and-forget)

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` | Falls back to `/api/mock/hubspot` (built-in mock) |

**Flow:**
1. Search HubSpot for an existing contact by email
2. Create or update the contact (`email`, `firstname`, `lastname`)
3. Create a deal linked to the contact (`dealname` = order name, `amount` = order total)

If `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` is not set, the app logs to the mock endpoint instead of failing silently.

---

### BirdEye

Sends review request emails to customers after order fulfillment.

**Trigger:** `orders/fulfilled` webhook → `webhooks.orders.fulfilled.jsx` (fire-and-forget)

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `BIRDEYE_ENDPOINT` | `/api/mock/birdeye` (built-in mock) |

Payload sent to BirdEye:

```json
{
  "customerEmail": "customer@example.com",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "orderId": "12345678"
}
```

Results are persisted to the `ReviewLog` table whether the request succeeds or fails.

---

## Webhooks

All webhooks are declared in `shopify.app.toml` and registered automatically on `shopify app deploy`.

| Topic | URI | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| `orders/create` | `/webhooks/orders/create` | Creates `OrderSync` record; triggers HoodslyHub + HubSpot sync |
| `orders/fulfilled` | `/webhooks/orders/fulfilled` | Sends BirdEye review request; persists to `ReviewLog` |
| `app/uninstalled` | `/webhooks/app/uninstalled` | Marks shop as uninstalled; deletes sessions |
| `app/scopes_update` | `/webhooks/app/scopes_update` | Updates session scope record when merchant grants/revokes scopes |

> **Note:** Webhooks created manually in the Shopify admin will fail HMAC validation. Always use app-specific webhooks defined in `shopify.app.toml`.

### Triggering webhooks via CLI

```bash
# Trigger an orders/create webhook with test data
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/create

# Trigger an orders/fulfilled webhook
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/fulfilled
```

> The `admin` object will be `undefined` for CLI-triggered webhooks since the shop is simulated.

---

## Retry Processor

Failed HoodslyHub syncs are automatically retried via a dedicated endpoint.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/retry-processor`

This endpoint finds all `OrderSync` records with `status = "failed"` where `nextRetryAt <= now()` and re-attempts the sync. It should be called on a schedule (e.g. every 5 minutes via cron, Render cron job, or GitHub Actions).

**Securing the endpoint** (recommended in production):

```bash
# In your .env
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-token
```

Then call the endpoint with a `Bearer` token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" \
  https://your-app-url.com/api/retry-processor
```

If `CRON_SECRET` is not set, the endpoint is open (acceptable for local dev, not for production).

## Testing

### Testing the Product Configurator (Manual Product Selection)

This walkthrough creates an Option Set scoped to manually selected products, verifies it publishes to the correct metafields, and confirms the cart transform extension applies the price adder at checkout.

#### Step 1 — Create a new Option Set

1. Navigate to `/app/configurator`
2. Click **New Option Set**
3. Fill in the **Name** field, e.g. `Custom Engraving`
4. Under **Scope**, select **Manual** and use the product picker to choose one or more specific products from your dev store

#### Step 2 — Add fields to the Option Set

Add at least two fields to test both input types and price adders:

| Field label | Type | Options / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Engraving Text` | Text | No price adder — free text input |
| `Font Style` | Dropdown | Add options: `Script (+$5.00)`, `Block (+$3.00)`, `Print (free)` |

For each dropdown option, set the **Price Adder** value (e.g. `5.00` for Script).

#### Step 3 — Save and verify metafield publishing

1. Click **Save**
2. In the Shopify admin, open one of the products you selected in Step 1
3. Scroll to **Metafields** → look for `app.configurator_definition`
4. The value should be a JSON object matching the field schema you defined

> **Tip:** You can also verify via the GraphQL Admin API:
> ```graphql
> {
>   product(id: "gid://shopify/Product/YOUR_PRODUCT_ID") {
>     metafield(namespace: "app", key: "configurator_definition") {
>       value
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

#### Step 4 — Test the cart transform at checkout

1. Open your dev store's storefront and navigate to one of the manually scoped products
2. Add it to the cart — the storefront theme must pass configurator selections as a cart line attribute (key: `configurator_selections`, value: JSON, e.g. `{"Font Style":"Script"}`)
3. View the cart — a hidden **Custom Options** line item should appear with the correct price adder (`+$5.00` for Script)
4. Proceed to checkout to confirm the total reflects the adder

> **Note:** If the hidden line item does not appear, confirm:
> - The cart line attribute key matches exactly `configurator_selections`
> - The product has the `app.configurator_definition` metafield published (Step 3)
> - The cart transform extension is deployed: `shopify app deploy`

#### Step 5 — Edit the Option Set and re-verify

1. Return to `/app/configurator` and open the **Custom Engraving** Option Set
2. Change the `Script` price adder to `$8.00` and save
3. Add the product to the cart again and confirm the new adder is applied at checkout

#### Step 6 — Delete the Option Set

1. From `/app/configurator`, click **Delete** on the Option Set
2. Verify in the Shopify admin that the `app.configurator_definition` metafield has been cleared from the scoped products

### Testing integrations with mock endpoints

All three integrations have local mock endpoints. By default they return a success response and log the payload to the console. No external credentials are needed for local development.

| Integration | Success mock | Force failure |
|---|---|---|
| HoodslyHub | `HOODSLYHUB_ENDPOINT` unset → auto mock | `MOCK_HOODSLYHUB_FAIL=true` |
| BirdEye | `BIRDEYE_ENDPOINT` unset → auto mock | `MOCK_BIRDEYE_FAIL=true` |
| HubSpot | `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` unset → auto mock | `MOCK_HUBSPOT_FAIL=true` |

**Example: test HoodslyHub retry logic**

```bash
# In .env — force every HoodslyHub call to fail
MOCK_HOODSLYHUB_FAIL=true
RETRY_DELAY_OVERRIDE_MS=2000   # shorten retry delay to 2 s for fast testing

# Trigger a new order webhook
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/create

# Check the Order Sync dashboard at /app/order-sync
# The record will appear as "Failed" then retry automatically
# Call the retry processor to force a retry immediately:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/retry-processor
```

**Example: test BirdEye failure + manual retry**

```bash
MOCK_BIRDEYE_FAIL=true

# Trigger a fulfillment webhook
shopify webhook trigger --topic orders/fulfilled

# Go to /app/review-log — the row will show "failed"
# Click "Retry" to manually re-trigger the request
```

### Testing the Order Report CSV export

1. Navigate to `/app/order-report`
2. Optionally apply date/tag filters
3. Click **Export CSV** — a `.csv` file will download directly in the browser
